> A **protocol** defines a blueprint of methods, properties, and other requirements that suit a particular task or piece of functionality. The protocol can then be _adopted_ by a class, structure, or enumeration to provide an actual implementation of those requirements. Any type that satisfies the requirements of a protocol is said to **conform** to that protocol.
