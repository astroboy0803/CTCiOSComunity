> A **protocol** defines a blueprint of methods, properties, and other requirements that suit a particular task or piece of functionality. The protocol can then **be adopted** by a **class**, **structure**, or **enumeration** to provide an **actual implementation** of those requirements. Any type that satisfies the requirements of a protocol is said to **conform** to that protocol.
