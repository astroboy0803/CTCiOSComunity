> **Extensions** add new functionality to an existing **class**, **structure**, **enumeration**, or **protocol** type. This includes the ability to extend types for which you **don’t have access to the original source code** (known as _retroactive modeling_). Extensions are similar to **categories** in Objective-C. (Unlike Objective-C categories, Swift extensions don’t have names.)

#### 透過Extension為現有type加入
